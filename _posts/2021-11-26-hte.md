So there is this channel on YT called the Online Causal Inference Seminar where you can watch talks by amazing researchers like Susan Athey. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo) talk by her. It is amazing. Don't get everything just yet but I'm going to watch her course on the AEA continuing education website ASAP. This and the last post are just trial posts, I'll write a lot more in them later.

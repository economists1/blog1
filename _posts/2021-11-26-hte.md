So there is this channel on YT called the Online Causal Inference Seminar where you can watch talks by amazing researchers like Susan Athey. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo)talk by her. It is amazing. This and the last post are just trial posts, I'll write a lot more in them later.
